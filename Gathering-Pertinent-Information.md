# **PROBLEM DEFINATION**
The Agricultural Department of Dharwad requires automated seed sowing machines to reduce Human indulgence and steer productivity.

#  **ABSTRACT**

India is an agrarian community. About 46% of the available land is used for agriculture.[1] A country where a farmer's life has never been easy, from sowing to ploughing and then irrigation, the amount of hard work that a lay-man has to put is needless to say. About half of the total population of the country has chosen agriculture as their chief occupation. In the field of agriculture  In such a country where agriculture is of such eminence, use of technology in this field is mandatory. The remote-controlled seed sowing bot helps farmers to sow seeds in an easier, more efficient and a less time consuming way. Seed sowing is one of the vital process in agriculture, but it is quite exhausting and time consuming. The bot which is wireless helps to automate the entire process, by which the process will be less exhausting for the farmer and will be more efficient.

# **NEED**
The History dates back to a century when the green revolution started and hence from then on there is no looking back, with more than 70% people depending on agriculture, the conventional method of seed sowing is slowly turning to be more sophisticated.No control over the depth of seed placement, No uniformity in the distribution of seed placement, Loss of seeds, No proper germination of seeds, and back pain being major issues of the age old method. There is definitely a need to automate the whole process for better yeild and to benefit a larger audience.[2]


# **Existing solutions to given the given problem**

***
Some of the existing solutions to the given problem are mentioned below-

***
## **Automatic Seed Sowing Robot**

***
It is a fully automatic seed sowing robot that automates this task. The robot uses four motors for running it in desired directions. It uses a small bracket for pouring seeds. The robot consists of a funnel like arrangement in order to pour seeds into a lower container. There it uses a shaft with gear like bucket teeth to pick up limited quantity of seeds and pour them on the ground in a steady manner in proper quantity.[3]

## **Automated robot for seed sowing and fertilizer spraying along with weed remover based on MSP430 controller**

***
The controller used here is the “MSP430 Micro-controller”. The micro-controller is brain of this system, which can dedicate the order of suggestions received to all the networks, and sensible factors processed by their corresponding embedded programs. Robotic mechanism played by their internal motors and motor drivers that drive the motors in desired directions. Here the one will monitor the robot and send the signal. According to the received signal the robot will move in the direction and it will place the seed and fertilizer on field for specified distance. The seeds are sowed in 4 rows at a single instance.[4]

## **Automated seed sowing machine**

***
It is an automated seed sowing machine which contains micro-controllers sensors, motor driving circuit, sowing mechanism and motors. The IR sensor module has been used to count the number of rotations of the wheel. From this count of rotation it can cover a specific distance and send the signal to the micro-controller. Then the micro controller activates the seed sowing mechanism and it sows the seed. The plough and sand cover operations are done as the rover moves forward. [5]

Description:
The robot consists of a funnel like arrangement in order to pour seeds into a lower container. There we use a shaft with gear like bucket teeth to pick up limited quantity of seeds and pour them on the ground in a steady manner in proper quantity. The front of the robot can be further fitted with a bent plate that drags on the soil to make a slot ahead of the machine before seeds are poured in it. The back portion of the robot can be fitted with a tail like bent rod that is again used to pour soil on seeds sowed thus covering them with soil. Thus the system completely automated the seed sowing process using a smartly designed mechanical robotic system.

  *  8051 Micro-controller- It is used to store the seed in a M by N pattern.The micro-controller 8051 applications include large amount of machines, principally because it is simple to incorporate in a project or to assemble a machine around it.

 * L293D motor driver-It is used to control the DC motor. It allows you to control the working speed and direction of two motors simultaneously.
 *ULN2003-The ULN2003 is known for its high-current, high-voltage capacity. The drivers can be paralleled for even higher current output. Even further, stacking one chip on top of another, both electrically and physically, has been done. Generally it can also be used for interfacing with a stepper motor, where the motor requires high ratings which cannot be provided by other interfacing devices.

  * IR Sensor-An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings.

    An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion.This sensor is like a human’s visionary

    senses, which can be used to detect obstacles and it is one of the common applications in real time.

  * Stepper Motor- It is a DC motor that works in discrete steps.

* Servo motor-A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism. If motor is used is DC powered then it is called DC servo motor, and if it is AC powered motor then it is called AC servo motor.[10]
