#  **ABSTRACT**

India is an agrarian community. About 46% of the available land is used for agriculture.[1] A country where a farmer's life has never been easy, from sowing to ploughing and then irrigation, the amount of hard work that a lay-man has to put is needless to say. About half of the total population of the country has chosen agriculture as their chief occupation. In the field of agriculture  In such a country where agriculture is of such eminence, use of technology in this field is mandatory. The remote-controlled seed sowing bot helps farmers to sow seeds in an easier, more efficient and a less time consuming way. Seed sowing is one of the vital process in agriculture, but it is quite exhausting and time consuming. The bot which is wireless helps to automate the entire process, by which the process will be less exhausting for the farmer and will be more efficient.

# **NEED**
The History dates back to a century when the green revolution started and hence from then on there is no looking back, with more than 70% people depending on agriculture, the conventional method of seed sowing is slowly turning to be more sophisticated.No control over the depth of seed placement, No uniformity in the distribution of seed placement, Loss of seeds, No proper germination of seeds, and back pain being major issues of the age old method. There is definitely a need to automate the whole process for better yeild and to benefit a larger audience.[2]


# **Existing solutions to given the given problem**

***
Some of the existing solutions to the given problem are mentioned below-

***
## **Automatic Seed Sowing Robot**

***
It is a fully automatic seed sowing robot that automates this task. The robot uses four motors for running it in desired directions. It uses a small bracket for pouring seeds. The robot consists of a funnel like arrangement in order to pour seeds into a lower container. There it uses a shaft with gear like bucket teeth to pick up limited quantity of seeds and pour them on the ground in a steady manner in proper quantity.[3]

## **Automated robot for seed sowing and fertilizer spraying along with weed remover based on MSP430 controller**

***
The controller used here is the “MSP430 Micro-controller”. The micro-controller is brain of this system, which can dedicate the order of suggestions received to all the networks, and sensible factors processed by their corresponding embedded programs. Robotic mechanism played by their internal motors and motor drivers that drive the motors in desired directions. Here the one will monitor the robot and send the signal. According to the received signal the robot will move in the direction and it will place the seed and fertilizer on field for specified distance. The seeds are sowed in 4 rows at a single instance.[4]

## **Automated seed sowing machine**

***
It is an automated seed sowing machine which contains micro-controllers sensors, motor driving circuit, sowing mechanism and motors. The IR sensor module has been used to count the number of rotations of the wheel. From this count of rotation it can cover a specific distance and send the signal to the micro-controller. Then the micro controller activates the seed sowing mechanism and it sows the seed. The plough and sand cover operations are done as the rover moves forward. [5]

## **Mechanizing farms through seed plantation**

***
A machine which will meet the farmers requirements using engineering specifications. Stability, hand control and comfort being the important requirements. the final design is broken down into five subsections: Frame, Dibber, Hopper, Transmission system and scotch yoke mechanism, and then the total system was fabricated and attached together.

5. Automated seed sowing machine-
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0BFd1jPQEc[13]

Description:They use the IR sensor module to count the number of rotations of the wheel. From this count of rotation they can cover a specific distance and it will send the signal to the microcontroller.After receiving the signal microcontroller will activate the motor driving circuit and depending on conditions dc motors are operated. Microcontroller keep counting the number of seeds sown in a row as well as the total number of columns in which seeds are sown.After moving predefined specific distance motor will turn off and seed will be sowed according to the sowing mechanism and this process will be repeated. In sowing mechanism, stepper motor is used. It is used to drop only one seed at a time. It has step angle 1.8 degree.

6. Automated seed sowing Bot
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zje7rHNDD7c[14]

Description:
The robot consists of a funnel like arrangement in order to pour seeds into a lower container. There we use a shaft with gear like bucket teeth to pick up limited quantity of seeds and pour them on the ground in a steady manner in proper quantity. The front of the robot can be further fitted with a bent plate that drags on the soil to make a slot ahead of the machine before seeds are poured in it. The back portion of the robot can be fitted with a tail like bent rod that is again used to pour soil on seeds sowed thus covering them with soil. Thus the system completely automated the seed sowing process using a smartly designed mechanical robotic system.
