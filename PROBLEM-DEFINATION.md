Agriculture has been the the backbone of the nation. unethical agricultural practices have resulted in the production of poor, unhealthy food crops. India ranks 143rd among the the 188 countries in the world health index and is definitely not a matter of pride. The process of seed sowing has been very exhausting for farmers and making the work more tiresome. this field requires automation so that the amount of human intervention is reduced and the process takes place more fast paced and more ethical manner. Here we design and manufacture a bot which is fully automated and contributes to a larger good. We mainly keep in mind that any unskilled uneducated farmer should be able to operate the bot.
